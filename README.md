# django-villager-databse

Hello everybody, this is a project that I used to start learning Django. It is based on the popular Nintendo Switch game Animal Crossing New Horizons. 

This project has helped me understand the basics of the Django framework and was a lot of fun to make. I learned about Django routing, templates, views, models, and deploying to Heroku.

This project has been deployed to heroku and can be found here : https://villager-database.herokuapp.com/
